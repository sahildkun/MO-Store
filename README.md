MO STORE

I am excited to share with you about an eCommerce project I made called "Mo Store", which has been developed using React and state management is done using Redux Toolkit.

One of the key features of Mo Store is the use of Redux Toolkit for state management. Redux Toolkit is a powerful library that simplifies the process of managing state in React applications. It provides a set of tools and conventions that make it easier to write efficient, scalable, and maintainable code.

With Redux Toolkit, Mo Store is able to handle complex state management requirements and persisting state with redux-persist, such as managing the user's cart, tracking orders and React Context API for minor state managements

By integrating Stripe into Mo Store, users can complete their purchases quickly and securely, without having to leave the website. This helps to improve the overall user experience and reduces the risk of cart abandonment and implementation of netlify serverless-functions to mediate payment

In addition to Redux Toolkit, Mo Store also makes use of other popular libraries and frameworks, such as React Router and Material UI.

Mo Store uses Firebase's authentication service to allow users to sign up and log in to the website using a variety of methods, such as email and password and Google along with new user registration

Once a user is authenticated, their user information and preferences are stored in Firebase's real-time database. This database allows for seamless synchronization of data between the frontend and backend of the application, making it easy to manage user data and preferences in real-time.

Form validation is applied using Formik and Yup

Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy checking out Mo Store!
